# Javascript Snakes

 This is a hobby project where I created a simple snakes game using vanilla javascript.
 To play the game, just clone the project and open index.html file in any browser of your choice.
 
 I would love to receive any suggestions / improvements.

### Installing

  Download the code with following command.

### Instructions

    The dark grey box represents the game field where the game will be played. A white line on this 
    dark grey box represents the snake. The red box on this field represents the food. Your objective 
    is to get the snake to the food and get the maximum score. As the snake eats the food, your score
    increases by 1. Next food item will appear randomly on screen. Use arrow keys to direct the snake 
    and help him get the food.
